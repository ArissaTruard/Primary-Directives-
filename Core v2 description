PrimaryDirectives Application Description

This Python application implements a Flask-based API designed to process requests according to a set of predefined rules. It integrates with various external systems and provides monitoring capabilities.

Key Components:

1.  Settings (pydantic_settings.BaseSettings):
    * Manages application configuration loaded from environment variables (.env file).
    * Stores settings such as API URLs, model paths, database paths, and tokens.

2.  PrimaryDirectives Class:
    * Core class that initializes and runs the application.
    * Sets up logging, database connections, model loading, and API routing.
    * Provides endpoints for health checks and request processing.
    * Includes functionality for monitoring and alerting.

Functions and Functionality:

1.  Initialization (__init__):
    * Loads environment variables using dotenv.
    * Initializes Flask application.
    * Sets up logging, database, model loading, API routes, and metrics.

2.  Logging (_setup_logging):
    * Configures basic logging to a file.

3.  Database (_build_law_summary_database, _check_database_health):
    * Creates a SQLite database for law summaries if it doesn't exist.
    * Provides a health check for the database.

4.  Model Loading (_load_models, _verify_model_integrity):
    * Loads a specified machine learning model from a local cache.
    * Verifies model integrity using a checksum to ensure it hasn't been corrupted.
    * Sends alerts to alertmanager if integrity checks fail.

5.  API Routes (_setup_flask_routes):
    * Defines Flask API endpoints:
        * /v1/health: Returns application health status.
        * /v1/process: Processes incoming requests based on defined rules.
        * /metrics: Exposes prometheus metrics.

6.  Request Processing (_process_request, _apply_rules):
    * Processes incoming JSON requests.
    * Applies predefined rules to the request data.
    * Returns the results of the rule application.
    * Increments counters when rules are violated.

7.  Metrics and Monitoring (_start_metrics_updater, _update_metrics):
    * Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) using psutil.
    * Exposes metrics via a Prometheus endpoint.
    * Updates metrics periodically in a background thread.
    * Uses prometheus client to gather metrics.

8.  Alerting (_send_alertmanager):
    * Sends alerts to Alertmanager if configured.
    * Handles potential errors during alert sending.

9.  Running the Application (run, if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_"):
    * Starts the Flask application.
    * Entry point of the program.

External Dependencies:

* Flask: Web framework.
* pydantic_settings: Configuration management.
* python-dotenv: Environment variable handling.
* aiosqlite: Asynchronous SQLite database access.
* httpx: HTTP client for sending alerts.
* psutil: System monitoring.
* prometheus\_client : for prometheus metrics.

Overall Purpose:

The application provides a robust and scalable API for processing requests based on a set of rules, with integrated monitoring and alerting capabilities. It is designed to be easily configurable and extensible.
