TOLERANCES:
This dictionary defines baseline or acceptable ranges for various environmental conditions.
These values are used in conjunction with the CONDITIONS dictionary to determine when
environmental readings exceed acceptable levels and trigger alerts.

Location Context:
These values are generally representative of a comfortable spring day in the United States.
Background radiation levels are based on average readings in the US.
