General Suggestions (Applicable to All):
 * Operation Timeouts:
   * Implement timeouts for individual operations within the sub functions (encryption, deletion, complex rule check) instead of just a global timeout. This can prevent long-running operations from blocking the entire function.
 * Error Handling:
   * Add more specific error handling for each operation. For example, catch specific exceptions related to encryption or database operations.
 * Context Validation:
   * While the current context validation is good, consider adding more specific validation for the data within the context. For example, check the types and ranges of data values.
 * Logging:
   * Consider adding more context to your logging. For example, logging the user or the request origin.
   * If very high volumes of requests are being processed, consider adding conditional logging, so that not every single call to sub functions logs every single step.
 * Modularization:
   * Consider further modularizing the code by extracting common logic into separate functions or classes. This can improve code readability and maintainability.
Specific Suggestions:
1.  PrimaryDirectives:
 * Database Session Management:
   * For more complex database interactions, use a context manager or dependency injection to manage sessions efficiently.
 * Concurrency:
   * For high-traffic scenarios, use asynchronous frameworks like asyncio or uvicorn to handle requests concurrently.
   * If there are any long running tasks, consider using a background task queue, like Celery.
 * Configuration Management:
   * For complex configurations, use a dedicated configuration library like Dynaconf or Hydra.
 * Rule Performance:
   * If you have many rules, optimize the rule application logic. Use a rule engine or a decision tree.
 * Backup Strategy:
   * Implement a more robust backup strategy with incremental backups and off-site storage.
 * Health Check Enhancements:
   * Add more detailed health checks, such as database connectivity checks and dependency checks.
 * Input Validation:
   * Add more input validation to API endpoints.
 * Metrics:
   * Add more metrics to monitor performance.
 * Shutdown handling:
   * Add an explicit cleanup method, that is called during shutdown to close database connections, and any other resources.
2.  sub1_encrypt:
 * Encryption Specific Errors:
   * Add specific exception handling for encryption-related errors.
 * Key Management:
   * Consider how you manage and rotate encryption keys.
3.  sub2_delete:
 * Deletion Specific Errors:
   * Add specific exception handling for deletion-related errors.
 * Deletion Logic:
   * Implement the actual logic for deleting inactive copies.
 * File locking:
   * If your deletion method removes files, ensure that you use file locking, to prevent race conditions.
4.  sub3_complex_rule:
 * Complex Rule Logic:
   * Ensure that the check_complex_rule method is well-documented and thoroughly tested.
 * Rule Complexity:
   * If the rule becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable rules.
 * Rule Caching:
   * If rules are static, or change infrequently, consider caching the results of the rules.
