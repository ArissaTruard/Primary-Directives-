## Archive Notes
This repository contains all preserved versions of the Primary Directives Application.
Each version is tagged OLD-V#.#_[code name] to reflect its stage of development.

- OLD-V1 → Initial scaffolding with full submodules
- OLD-V2 → Simplified law integration
- OLD-V3 → Condensed arbitration loop
- OLD-V4 → Incremental refinements
- OLD-V5 → Major restructuring
- OLD-V6 → Pre-final draft
- OLD-V7 → Latest preserved version before open-source release

The intent is to preserve the full evolution of the framework, including abandoned modules,
so future reviewers can trace design decisions and recover useful logic if needed.
