Here's a comprehensive summary of the four code segments:
1. PrimaryDirectives (Main Application Class):
 * Core Functionality:
   * This class represents the main Flask application, acting as an "Action Filter."
   * It handles API requests, enforces primary directives rules, manages database interactions, and provides health and metrics endpoints.
   * It also includes sub-functions for specific operations (encryption, deletion, complex rule checks).
 * Key Features:
   * Configuration management using Pydantic settings.
   * Database setup and interaction using SQLAlchemy.
   * Rule application and enforcement.
   * Error handling and logging.
   * Secure backup creation and integrity checks.
   * Prometheus metrics exposure.
   * API endpoints for processing requests, corrections, health checks, and secure shutdowns.
   * Api endpoints for calling sub functions.
 * Purpose:
   * To provide a secure and policy-compliant framework for processing data and enforcing rules.
2. sub1_encrypt (Encryption Sub-function):
 * Core Functionality:
   * This function is responsible for encrypting data based on the provided context.
   * It adheres to the primary directives rules by applying them before encryption.
 * Key Features:
   * Context validation using the DataContext model.
   * Rule application and violation checks.
   * Data encryption using Fernet.
   * Error handling and logging.
   * Timeout management.
   * Returns a dictionary with result information.
 * Purpose:
   * To securely encrypt data while ensuring compliance with defined rules.
3. sub2_delete (Deletion Sub-function):
 * Core Functionality:
   * This function handles the deletion of inactive copies of code or data.
   * It also adheres to the primary directives rules.
 * Key Features:
   * Context validation.
   * Rule application and violation checks.
   * Deletion of inactive copies (placeholder for actual implementation).
   * Error handling and logging.
   * Timeout management.
   * Returns a dictionary with result information.
 * Purpose:
   * To manage the deletion of inactive copies while adhering to defined policies.
4. sub3_complex_rule (Complex Rule Check Sub-function):
 * Core Functionality:
   * This function evaluates a complex rule based on the provided context.
   * It also enforces the primary directives rules.
 * Key Features:
   * Context validation.
   * Rule application and violation checks.
   * Complex rule evaluation using the check_complex_rule method.
   * Error handling and logging.
   * Timeout management.
   * Returns a dictionary with result information.
 * Purpose:
   * To evaluate complex rules and ensure compliance with defined policies.
Overall Summary:
The code represents a secure and policy-driven application framework. The PrimaryDirectives class acts as the central hub, managing API requests, database interactions, and rule enforcement. The sub functions (sub1, sub2, sub3) are modular components that perform specific tasks (encryption, deletion, complex rule checks) while adhering to the primary directives rules. They all use context validation, rule application, error handling, and timeout management to ensure robustness and compliance.
